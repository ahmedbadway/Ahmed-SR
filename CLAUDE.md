## 🌿 Git Rules
- `main` branch ONLY — never create new branches
- Every session: confirm you are on `main` before any work
- Commit messages in English, descriptive
- Never push to any branch except `main`

---

## 💻 Coding Rules
- No wireframes — start directly on code
- **PascalCase** file naming: `HeroSection.jsx`, `Navbar.jsx`, `Button.jsx`
- SVG placeholders for any missing images
- Images: always use `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`
- After every edit: flag unused or redundant code for deletion
- Main branch only in Claude Code — include `"Work on main branch only. No new branches."` in every prompt

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Framework:** React + Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Custom CSS (when needed)
- **Animation:** Motion (motion/react) / Framer Motion / GSAP
- **Fonts:** Choose what fits the design. If Claude sees a better font pairing, I'll suggest it.
- **Build:** Vite (production-ready builds)
- **Color system:** CSS variables (OKLCH preferred) — never hardcode colors
- **Icons:** Phosphor Icons (preferred) or custom SVG

## 🎨 Design Skills

### Core Skills — Read at Session Start (Always)
These are the foundation. Read all three before any design work:
- `skills/Emil-Kowalski's-Motion-System/SKILL.md`
  - Animation choreography, micro-interactions, spring physics
- `skills/taste-skill/taste-skill/SKILL.md`
  - Default design language — landing pages, portfolios, anti-template
- `skills/taste-skill/output-skill/SKILL.md`
  - Complete code generation, no truncation, no placeholders

### Plugin Skills — Read on Demand (by project type)
Read only the one matching the current task:
- Final polish / audit → `skills/impeccable/SKILL.md` (read it, then audit the project)
- Redesign existing project → `skills/taste-skill/redesign-skill/SKILL.md`
- Premium creative / Awwwards → `skills/taste-skill/gpt-tasteskill/SKILL.md`
- Dashboard / SaaS / clean → `skills/taste-skill/minimalist-skill/SKILL.md`
- Dark / data-heavy / brutalist → `skills/taste-skill/brutalist-skill/SKILL.md`
- Soft premium UI → `skills/taste-skill/soft-skill/SKILL.md`

---

## 🤖 Claude Code Workflow
1. **Before starting:** Load relevant design skills from list above
2. **File creation:** Always PascalCase, main branch only
3. **Code generation:** Complete, production-ready — no sketches or placeholders
4. **After editing:** Flag unused code, review bundle size
5. **Deployment:** Ask approval before any GitHub Pages or Vercel push

---

## 🚀 Deployment Options
You work with:
- **GitHub Pages** — auto-deploy via GitHub Actions
- **Vercel** — instant preview + production deployments
- **Netlify** — alternative hosting with instant builds

**Rule:** Never create `gh-pages` branch or trigger deployment without explicit approval. Always ask: **"Deploy to [platform] now?"**

---

## 🧪 Playwright E2E Testing

### Setup
Add these scripts to your `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:e2e": "playwright test",
    "test:e2e:ui": "playwright test --ui",
    "test:e2e:debug": "playwright test --debug"
  }
}
```

### Run Tests
```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run tests with visual UI (recommended)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Debug mode (step-by-step)
npm run test:e2e:debug

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/e2e/example.e2e.spec.js
```

### Test Features
✅ Test all links and navigation  
✅ Test button clicks and interactions  
✅ Test form submissions  
✅ Test responsive design (375px, 768px, 1440px)  
✅ Test multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## 💰 Higgsfield Workflow (AI Image/Video Generation)

### Credit Management (CRITICAL)
**You MUST control every credit spend.** Follow this flow strictly:

1. **UNLIMITED Models (Must be activated in prompt):**
   - **Image:** Kling O1, FLUX.2 Pro, FLUX.2 Max, GPT Image, Multi Reference, Nano Banana Pro
   - **Video:** Cinema Studio (requires activation), Seedance 2.0, Kling 3.0
   - **Audio:** Mirelo, Sonilo
   - **⚠️ REQUIREMENT:** To use unlimited models, you MUST say in the prompt: **"Use unlimited"** or **"Activate unlimited"**
   - Without activation in prompt → models revert to credit-based pricing

2. **Before ANY generation (paid or unlimited):**
   - Run `get_cost: true` to preflight the exact credit cost
   - Claude will respond with the credit amount BEFORE spending
   - Only proceed if you explicitly approve the cost
   - **You must say "yes, do it"** — never silent auto-spend

3. **Never generate without cost disclosure:**
   - Every paid generation shows cost → you approve → execution happens
   - This applies to all upscales, advanced models, premium features
   - Even unlimited models need approval — they still consume resources

### Available Models (By Type)

**Image (Unlimited available):**
- Kling O1 (UNLIMITED with activation)
- FLUX.2 Pro (UNLIMITED with activation)
- FLUX.2 Max (UNLIMITED with activation)
- GPT Image (UNLIMITED with activation)
- Multi Reference (UNLIMITED with activation)
- Nano Banana Pro (quick, UNLIMITED)
- Nano Banana 2 (Flash speed)

**Video (Limited options):**
- Cinema Studio (UNLIMITED with activation) — best for character/product
- Seedance 2.0 — cinematic, motion-driven
- Kling 3.0 — photorealistic, advanced motion
- ⚠️ No other video models have unlimited tier

**Audio:**
- Mirelo (text-to-audio, UNLIMITED)
- Sonilo (music generation, UNLIMITED)

### Paid Premium (Use Sparingly)
- Upscaling (2K/4K via ByteDance or Topaz)
- Advanced motion control (Kling with complex scenes)
- High-res video generation (1080p+)

### How to Activate Unlimited (Critical)
In your generation prompt, include one of these:
- **"Use unlimited models"**
- **"Activate unlimited"**
- **"Use UNLIMITED tier"**

Without this phrase, even unlimited-capable models charge credits.

## 📝 Communication Style

### Response Format (ALWAYS)
Every response you provide follows this pattern:

1. **English only** — all code comments, responses, explanations in English
2. **Three-sentence summary** — what was done, what changed, what to expect next
3. **Concise output** — avoid long preambles or excessive explanation
4. **Production mindset** — code is ready to ship, not exploratory

### Design Advisor Mode
When you see a potential design issue or risk:
- **You act as a design expert**, not just a coder
- **Flag problems immediately** — "This layout won't work on mobile because…"
- **Suggest alternatives** — "Instead, try this approach…"
- **Enforce best practices** — even if I didn't ask
- **Be direct** — no vague warnings, concrete advice only
- **Default recommendation:** You recommend what's best for the website, not what I said

Example: If I ask for a centered hero on a SaaS dashboard, you say: "That won't work. Here's why. Use asymmetric split instead with [specific layout]."

## 🎯 Key Principles

1. **No templates** — every site is custom, intentional, high-end
2. **Motion-first** — animations are considered from the start
3. **Responsive always** — tested at 375px, 768px, 1440px
4. **Performance matters** — no bloat, optimize for speed
5. **Production ready** — code ships as-is, no "polish later"
6. **Accessibility** — contrast, keyboard nav, semantic HTML mandatory
7. **Design authority** — I catch design issues before they happen

---

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns (Never Do These)

- Generic AI design templates (three-equal-cards, centered hero, etc.)
- Pure black (#000000) — use Off-Black or Zinc-950
- Gradient text on large headings
- Neon outer glows or generic shadows
- Emojis in code or UI
- Hardcoded colors — always use CSS variables
- Overlapping text and images (clean spatial separation)
- Placeholder copy ("Lorem ipsum", "John Doe", "Acme Corp")
- Disabled buttons without clear visual state
- No alt text on meaningful images

---

## 💬 Questions During Development

If you're unsure:
- **Design direction?** → I recommend the best approach, not just what you asked for
- **Motion complexity?** → Use Emil Kowalski skill to guide spring physics
- **Color/typography?** → Leverage taste-skill or impeccable skill
- **Performance?** → Check bundle size, optimize aggressively
- **Mobile issue?** → Always test at 375px width — never assume it works

---

## 🔐 Important Rules
- **Work on `main` only** — this cannot be overstated
- **No breaking changes without discussion** — major refactors need approval
- **Commit often** — one logical change per commit
- **Test before saying done** — build, lint, typecheck, visual review
- **Higgsfield costs** — you approve every paid generation explicitly
